My name is Austin Hamilton. I am a Senior here at ETSU with a concentration in CS. I am planning on applying to Oak Ridge National Laboratories in order to pursue a
career in High Performance Computing. I would like to eventually move on towards a master's and eventually doctorate's in this field. Some of my interests include
parallelized computing and distributed operating systems. Other than that, I am a laid back guy who likes to play pool and go disc golfing. I hike a lot and take pride
in the amount of hikes I have completed in the area.
